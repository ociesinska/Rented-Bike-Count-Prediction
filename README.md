This project involves building a robust machine learning model to predict bike-sharing demand.
The dataset used in this project is based on the publicly available Seoul Bike Sharing dataset but has been modified for educational purposes as part of a university Machine Learning class. 
These modifications include the addition of variables (feat01 to feat10) and adjustments to certain rows and columns, providing unique opportunities for analysis and model development.
The analysis begins with an extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover key insights and patterns in the data. It is followed by feature engineering to create meaningful variables and feature selection to enhance model performance.
 This project showcases the full pipeline of a machine learning workflow, from data preprocessing to model evaluation.
